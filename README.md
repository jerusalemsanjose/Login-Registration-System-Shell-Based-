# Terminal Authentication System
A shell-based login and registration system implemented in C++. This system provides a command-line interface for user management with features such as user registration, login, password and username updates, account lockout after multiple failed login attempts, and intuitive arrow-key navigation for command selection. This version is incomplete; several features are represented as placeholders and do actually work but not yet contain full logic. They are included to illustrate planned functionality and system flow.

## Features

- **User  Registration:** Allows new users to create an account with a unique username and password.
- **User  Login:** Secure login functionality with validation of credentials.
- **Password and Username Updates:** Users can update their login credentials after authentication.
- **Account Lockout:** Locks the user account after a predefined number of failed login attempts to enhance security.
- **Arrow-Key Navigation:** Supports arrow-key input for navigating through command options, improving user experience.
- **Full Backend Control:** Designed to provide backend management, focusing on functionality over frontend consistency.
